0,"Candle entrepreneur Jo Malone has joined 5,000 small business bosses praising the Tories' as the 'only people' who can keep the economy secure . Perfume entrepreneur Jo Malone has joined 5,000 small business bosses praising the Tories as the 'only people' who can keep the economy secure. In a major boost to the Conservatives' lacklustre campaign, the signatories - who together employ nearly 100,000 people - said they 'would like to see David Cameron and George Osborne given the chance to finish what they have started'. Ms Malone, one of the most high-profile names to sign the letter, this morning claimed a Labour government would 'jeopardise' the economic recovery. Appearing on Sky News, Ms Malone said she had sold her business to cosmetics giant Estee Lauder in 2006, but had 'started all over again' by setting up a new business three years ago. The new candle and fragrance business, called Jo Love, now employs 14 people she said. But Ms Malone claimed Labour were a risk to all small businesses like hers. She said: 'The world is looking at us as a really strong economy again. Its working, and people's lives are coming back together and jobs are being created, why would we jeopardise that? 'I've never put my head above the parapet in politics but I feel so passionately and so strongly this time that I do have to say something. And this is my voice I'm not representing anyone but myself and my business. 'With 10 days to go and from what I've seen I'm afraid my vote is not going to go to Ed Miliband it's going to David Cameron and I'm going to support them and I'm going to speak out because I believe this economy is on a very secure footing.' It comes as Mr Cameron attempts to move the arguments of the election campaign onto Britain's economic recovery. In a major boost to the Prime Minister - pictured in central London this morning - 5,000 businesses said they 'would like to see David Cameron and George Osborne given the chance to finish what they have started' Mr Cameron launched the Conservatives' small business manifesto this morning - promising to make Britain the best place in Europe to set up a company . The Tories' small business launch suffered an embarrassing blow this morning after one of the firms which apparently put its name to a letter in support of David Cameron withdrew its support – claiming it never signed it. Aurum Solutions has been removed from the letter  after saying its sales director did not sign it and that the company's policy is to remain 'politically unaligned'. The company asked for its name to be taken off the letter, tweeting: 'Our Sales Director did not sign the letter in support of the Conservative Party. Please remove signatory 413 immediately.' Aurum Solutions managing director Helen Belcher claimed that sales director Steve O'Hehir was sent an email by the Tories, then clicked on a link within it, but did not enter any details. But the Tories said all the signatories had to actively enter their details on the party website. A party spokesman said: 'Everyone whose name was published actively signed up to the letter on the Conservative Party's website.' The letter to the Telegraph states: 'We run small businesses right across the country. We work hard, make sacrifices and invest our own money to help our businesses grow and succeed. 'It was tough during the recession, but we kept going. This Conservative-led Government has been genuinely committed to making sure Britain is open for business. 'They've managed to get the economy moving again by tackling the deficit, helping to keep interest rates low and inflation down. We've been helped by their steps to lower taxes, reduce red tape, simplify employment law and get the banks lending.' A change to a Labour government the letter warns 'would be far too risky and would undo all the good work of the last 5 years'. The letter is designed to challenge Labour claims that the Tories only support big businesses. It was organised by Karren Brady, the star of the Apprentice and Tory peer and comes as the party today launches its small business manifesto. Baroness Brady said: 'Ed Miliband and his team don't really get what it is to run a business.' Writing in the Telegraph, she added: 'If Labour got into government and started wrecking our economy again, many more businesses would struggle and jobs would be lost. 'It doesn't bear thinking about. David Cameron and the Conservatives have a clear plan for this country which is already taking us in the right direction.' Mr Cameron appeared on ITV's  'Lorraine' this morning, with just a week and a half until polling day on May 7 . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna last night insisted Labour would be better for small businesses. He said: 'The Tories have spent five years letting down Britain's small businesses. Government scheme after government scheme designed to boost finance for small firms has failed, and small business lending has fallen by £500m in the last three months. 'With Labour, the tax burden on small firms will be lower than under the Tories who have overseen an increase in business rates of around £1,500. 'Labour's Better Plan will cut - then freeze - business rates, set up a Small Business Administration and a proper British Investment Bank to back small businesses. And only Labour will tackle late payment and the unfair treatment of small suppliers we've seen under the Tories.'","Bosses of over 5,000 small businesses sign a letter praising the Tories .

1,"Dozens of children witnessed a giraffe being gored to death by an antelope at a Norwegian zoo on Easter Monday. Melvin the giraffe had got his head stuck in a fence when he was attacked by an eland antelope walking in the same enclosure at Kristiansand zoo, around 200 miles south of Oslo. Zoo vets rushed to the scene, but were unable to save the five-year-old giraffe, who died in front of shocked families. Tragedy: Melvin the giraffe was attacked by an antelope walking in the same enclosure at Kristiansand Zoo in southern Norway . Around 30 people witnessed the unprovoked attack at Dyreparken Kristiansand on Monday. Melvin was a firm favourite among young visitors, having been named in a readers' competition in a national newspaper when he was born at the zoo in 2010. Witness Øivind Hansen, who was visiting the zoo with his family and photographed the event said even his 23-year-old daughter had come home crying after the incident. 'It was very traumatic. People were crying everywhere,' he told Verdens Gang. Melvin had gotten his horns stuck in the enclosure's fence when suddenly the eland, the second largest antelope in the world, suddenly attacked. Deadly attack: The large eland antelope gored five-year-old Melvin to death in an unprovoked attack after giraffe had gotten his head stuck in the enclosure's fence . Horrible scenes: Around 30 people, many of them children, witnessed Melvin, who was born at the zoo in 2010 and named in a local newspaper competition, die in the enclosure . 'He was panicking and tugged and tore to free himself, and then came a rather large animal with sharp horns and ran right into him,' Mr Hansen adds. 'It is incredibly sad,'  Dyreparken's chief executive told Dagbladet.no. 'He was alive when our veterinarian came to the scene, but died while he tried to save him.' 'Melvin was gored right near his lungs and heart, and the injuries were so serious that they killed him,' veterinarian Rolf Arne Ølberg, who was called to the scene, said. Mr Ølberg added that the two animals have been walking in the same enclosure since Melvin's birth in 2010 and has no idea why the antelope launched the deadly attack on the young giraffe.","Melvin the giraffe was killed by an antelope at Norwegian zoo .

To keep up with demand, the book's first printing was increased from 500,000 to 1 million copies, Barbara Marcus, president and publisher of Random House Children's Books, said in a news release Monday. ""We were absolutely overjoyed to see the response to 'What Pet Should I Get?' from every corner of the book world -- the bookselling community, media, educators, and readers nationwide,"" Marcus said. The publisher also released to CNN a never-before-seen image from the new volume by Dr. Seuss, aka Theodor Geisel. It features a brother and sister familiar to Seuss fans as they ogle a prim feline in a pet shop window and ponder: . ""We want a pet. We want a pet. What kind of pet . should we get?"" When ""What Pet Should I Get?"" debuts July 28, it will be the first new, original Dr. Seuss book since ""Oh, the Places You'll Go!"" in 1990.

4,"From the moment Jack Johnson beat Tommy Burns to win the world heavyweight title in 1908, a frenzied search began. While Johnson's victory wouldn't raise an eyebrow nowadays, it caused consternation in America for one simple reason: Johnson was black — and a black man had never held sport's greatest prize. Racism was rife in America: black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life. As the great boxing pundit Bert Sugar put it, 'This was the white man's crown. (To white America), it was as if the white man's slave had become his master.' After beating Tommy Burns in 1908, Jack Johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion . It is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that Johnson's victory caused. Even liberal newspapers, such as The New York Times, were openly hostile to the giant Texan. It mattered little that Johnson was American. His skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white America to find a white challenger — a 'Great White Hope' — who could unseat the new champion. But little did white America know that it would take over six years before Johnson would be defeated, on April 5, 1915, 100 years ago on Sunday. Most had believed Johnson would be dispatched quickly. However, he made short work of his first four title defences, his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock Johnson down. Yet Johnson had been fighting in second gear until that point and, as soon as he returned to his feet, scored a brutal knockout, uprooting several of Ketchel's teeth in the process. Attention immediately turned to finding another 'white hope'. There seemed an obvious choice: former world heavyweight champion James J Jeffries, who had retired undefeated in 1904. Jeffries, who as champion had dodged Johnson, was seen as someone who could quickly defeat the title holder and return things to the way they were. Things didn't go as planned. Six years out of the ring had taken its toll on Jeffries and in 1910 Johnson stopped the former champion in 15 rounds, further enraging whites who rioted, taking out their anger on blacks who had the temerity to celebrate Johnson's win. As many as 26 black people would be killed by lynch mobs. What made Johnson even more unbearable to white America was the way he lived his life. A fun-loving character, Johnson dated and married white women, and refused to live according to the social norms of the time. He was intelligent, eloquent and ambitious and saw no reason why his being black should hold him back from doing whatever he wanted. American heavyweight boxer Jess Willard (left) with his manager Tom Jones in Havana, Cuba in April 1915 . Johnson loses his world heavyweight title to Willard (left) over the course of 26 rounds in Havana in 1915 . Like Muhammad Ali years later, he was a trailblazer. He suffered dreadful discrimination, death threats and later persecution at the hands of the government. He took most of it in his stride. The same cannot be said of his detractors whose efforts to unseat him became increasingly desperate. In 1912, one opponent, 'Fireman' Jim Flynn, was disqualified for repeatedly trying to headbutt Johnson. Things were getting ridiculous, but Johnson's life outside the ring was unravelling. He spent money like it grew on trees and was being investigated by the US government on the spurious charge of abducting his future second wife under what was known as the Mann Act, a dubious piece of legislation designed to prevent 'white slavery'. He was found guilty by an all-white jury and sentenced to a year in prison. Johnson had other ideas. He fled to Canada and then to Europe, fighting three times in Paris, where he made history by beating 'Battling' Jim Johnson in the first-ever all-black heavyweight championship bout. Next he outpointed American Frank Moran over 20 rounds, though the purses for the fight were frozen after a dispute. With his money running low and the First World War breaking out in Europe, he accepted the challenge of another 'white hope' from America. His name was Jess Willard, a 6ft 6in fighter, known as 'The Pottawatomie Giant.' To put Willard's size into perspective, the average height of an American man at the time was 5ft 7in. The fight would take place in Cuba and was scheduled for 45 three-minute rounds, a hell of a distance given the 40-degree heat on the day. How would Johnson, now 37, handle a challenger four years his junior? The champion had, quite arrogantly, barely trained for the fight. Still, Willard was certainly the underdog: his size meant he was not particularly agile and he did not like hurting opponents unless they had hurt him first. Johnson was supremely confident. Johnson dominated the opening 10 rounds but his lack of conditioning soon began to tell. His breathing became heavy, amid the sweltering heat, and Willard grew in confidence. The writing was on the wall at the end of round 25. Johnson, sat on his stool, called over fight promoter Jack Curley. 'Jack, go take my wife away...tell her I'm awful weak and I want her to leave.' In the next round Willard seized his chance. He faked to throw a left to the body and then swung a mighty overhand right that connected perfectly with Johnson's jaw. Johnson slumped to the canvas and took the count flat on his back. It was the victory that white America had been waiting for but was all as it seemed? Action from the world heavyweight title fight between Johnson and Willard in Havana, Cuba in 1915 . Photographs of the knockout appeared to show Johnson shielding his eyes from the sun and he would later claim this was because he had deliberately taken a fall. His motivation, Johnson said, was a $50,000 payout and a promise from the American authorities that he could finally return to his homeland without having to serve his prison sentence. Johnson's 'confession' was sold for a fee to Nat Fleischer, the respected founder of The Ring magazine. But Fleischer never believed Johnson, while Willard was bitter about Johnson's claim, especially as the victory was his finest hour. 'If he was going to throw the fight I wish he'd done it sooner,' Willard said. 'It was hotter than hell out there.' Much of the public believed Johnson and they had not seen the film of the contest as there was a ban on it being shown. It would take 40 years for the footage to see the light of day. When it did surface, Willard was vindicated, the film clearly showing him land a powerful blow. 'I've waited a long time but at last people are beginning to believe me when I say I that I beat Johnson fair and square.' Willard confronted Johnson over his claims in 1944. 'I asked him why he made his false statement,' Willard recalled. 'He just shrugged and gave me that gold-toothed smile of his. Jack knew and I knew he was lying. But the fella was desperate for money, so who could blame him.' Johnson would eventually end his exile and continue fighting into the 1930s. Tragically he would die in a car crash in 1946, speeding away from a diner that refused him service on account of his race. Willard would lose his world title in only his second defence, suffering an awful beating at the hands of Jack Dempsey before retiring to his farm in Kansas.

8,"Expectant mom AmberMarie Irving-Elkins felt a few contractions on Thursday morning but thought she had enough time to run a few last errands before the arrival of her baby. But the little boy, Malachi, had other ideas. She was in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in Los Angeles to pay a fine on Thursday when she suddenly knew he was coming - and there was no way she'd make it to hospital in time. 'I had that contraction that hit me and brought me to knees,' the mom-of-three told KTLA. Scroll down for video . Surprise: Baby Malachi Elkins was born in the hallways in a Los Angeles courthouse on Thursday morning as his mother, AmberMarie Irving-Elkins, was there to pay a fine. The baby boy was healthy . Clerks rushed to her side and alerted officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department who were inside the courthouse. Deputy Marquette Oliver ran over to assist her. 'She was like, 'I'm having the baby right now',' Oliver recalled. 'I was like, ""Hold on! Hold on!""' But there was no stopping baby Malachi. 'I had to push,' Irving-Elkins said, describing how she laid on the floor. 'That's when Sheriff Oliver said, ""Don't push, don't push!"" and I said, ""Oh, I've got to push"".' Relief: AmberMarie Irving-Elkins laughs about the birth while in hospital with her healthy newborn son . Helping hand: Deputy Marquette Oliver was in the courthouse and told her to stop pushing - but she could not . At the ready: He shows how he bent down to catch the baby boy as he slipped onto the floor . She pulled down her trousers and the baby's head was visible, Deputy Oliver said. So he bent down and caught the baby as he was born. 'It was all over in about five minutes,' said Associated Press reporter Anthony McCartney, who happened to be there. 'She gave birth in the hallway, pretty much unassisted.' It was the officers who told Irving-Elkins that she had given birth to a boy. Officers had surrounded the mother and blocked her off with cardboard boxes in a bid to give her some privacy in the busy hallways. McCartney said people started cheering when they realized a baby had been born. 'I don't think they even realized what was going on until they saw this woman had a baby, obviously a newborn, on her chest,' the reporter said. 'They cheered and clapped and everything.' Doing well: Malachi's mother said she thinks his birthplace means he might be a judge or a lawyer . Family: The mother and son were rushed to hospital, where they were met by his dad and older siblings . Scene: She was feeling contractions before she went into the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, pictured, but thought she had time to run some errands before heading to the hospital - but Malachi had other ideas . 'Mom & baby fine!' the Special Enforcement Bureau of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department tweeted Thursday, along with a photo of the healthy baby boy inside the courthouse. They were then taken to hospital, where Malachi met his dad, Nom, and two older siblings, who were grateful for the officers' actions. 'I do want to thank them for stepping in and stealing my shine,' Nom joked with KABC. 'No. Thank you. I'm glad he's here. He's healthy. We're happy. Everything's good.'

10,"The jury that sentenced Aaron Hernandez to life in prison on Wednesday want the world to know that they gave the ex-New England Patriots star a fair trial. The seven women and five men who voted to find the 25-year-old guilty of murder this week say it was a heart-wrenching decision, but one they made in confidence. On Thursday, the jury and alternate jurors say down with CNN's Anderson Cooper to talk about the trial that has consumed their lives for the past three months. Scroll down for video . Decided: The jury that voted Wednesday to send former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez to prison for life sat down for a group interview on Thursday with CNN's Anderson Cooper . Guilty: Hernandez was found guilty Wednesday of murdering Odin Lloyd in 2013. Pictured in court on Wednesday on the left, when the verdict was read. On the right, seen in a Patriots uniform before his arrest . When asked if they knew who Hernandez was before the trial started, most raised their hands. However, they maintained that Hernandez's notoriety didn't have an impact on their decision. 'It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you make. We're all people, and we're all equal, and we all deserve the same fair trial, and that's what we wanted to make sure we gave him,' juror Jon Carlson said. Only one juror, Rosalie Oliver, didn't know of the tight end who had a $40million contract with the local NFL team. On the other side of the spectrum is juror Kelly Dorsey - a lifelong Patriots fan, who watches the team every Sunday during football season. While most of the group said that they had no interaction with Hernandez during the trial, Dorsey says she locked eyes with him on Wednesday as the verdict was being read. Familiar: When asked if they knew Hernandez before the trial, most of the jury raised their hands . Gripping moment: Jury member Kelly Dorsey says she locked eyes with Hernandez as the verdict was being read on Wednesday . 'He was shaking his head and he mouthed something - and I didn't know what he mouthed - but he was shaking his head just staring and I thought 'You need to look back at the judge. Just look back at the judge.""'' Dorsey recalled. Sentencing Hernandez was no easy decision to come to for the jury who heard from 130 witnesses and reviewed 400 pieces of evidence since the trial started at the end of January. The group deliberated for 35 hours over the course of a week, and decided that certain aspects of victim Odin Lloyd's killing warranted a life in prison without the possibility of parole sentence - the highest sentence possible in the state of Massachusetts where the death penalty is outlawed. Many of the jurors pointed to the fact that Lloyd had been shot six times as evidence of the callousness of the crime. At the time of his death, Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianceé. 'You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There's no need for that and there's no need to use a gun. Period,' jury foreman Lesa Strachan said. Other jurors were shocked by Hernandez's casual behavior, sunbathing with friends just a few hours after Lloyd is suspected to have been murdered. Directly after court on Wednesday, Hernandez was taken to a prison just two miles from Gillette Stadium, where he traded his  $1.3million mansion for a small cell and a pair of gray scrubs. The jurors will now be allowed to return to their day jobs, but they say the time they spent on the jury will stay with them forever. Oliver and other jurors say friends have been calling them up to congratulate them after the verdict - something that has left them speechless. 'Who won? Odin Lloyd didn't win. (His mother) didn't bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he's 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that's never going to see her father again?' Oliver said.","The Aaron Hernandez jury and alternate jurors sat down as a group with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday .

11,"Sleepy shoppers in China have had a rude awakening – after being banned from napping in furniture store IKEA. The Swedish retailer has been forced to take action to stop visitors kicking off their shoes and going to sleep on their beds and sofas. The problem has got so bad that nappers had taken over more than half of beds and sofas in the Xihongmen IKEA shop in Beijing, The People’s Daily reported – with some even getting under the covers for a snooze. Scroll down for video . Managers at Swedish furniture store IKEA have now banned shoppers from sleeping in their beds and sofas . Sleepy shoppers have taken to kicking off their shoes and catching forty winks on the display furniture . The practice has become widespread in IKEA stores - with shoppers coming in especially to take a nap . One weary woman said she had come into IKEA especially to grab a quick forty winks in one of their ‘comfy’ beds. She said she didn’t think it was a big issue, saying: ‘Yes it may affect customers who were shopping in the store but it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.’ Another customer said: ‘Sleeping on the furniture will definitely affect other customers. I can understand the need to take a rest however if you are really having a sleep then that’s not very appropriate.’ One shopper said: 'Yes it may affect customers... but it shouldn't be too much of a problem'. Ikea disagree . IKEA employees said the problem is difficult to manage, because so many Chinese shoppers do it . But long-suffering staff at IKEA said the problem has become widespread across China – with management vowing to clamp down on the practice. Under the new rules customers will still be allowed to try out the sofas and beds, but the removal of shoes to sleep in the beds is banned. One anonymous IKEA assistant warned, however, it will be difficult to enforce the rules. ‘There are old people sleeping and many others are children, what can we say?’ they said. Another employee explained that they currently wake up shoppers if they have been sleeping for an extended period of time – but when they move them on, another quickly fills their place. By banning people from taking off their shoes, IKEA hope to stop Chinese shoppers falling asleep in the stores . Workers at IKEA shops regularly wake up exhausted shoppers - but another napper quickly takes their place . They added: ‘There are too many people doing this, it’s not possible to stop it.’ The MailOnline previously reported on the trend, which commentators saying their Beijing store is particularly popular for a nap because of its air-conditioning during the sweltering summers. It is not the first time IKEA has had to deal with over-familiar customers in China. One Shanghai Xuhui store was inundated with pensioners who would spend their time drinking the free coffee – and on the prowl for a new partner for their children. The practice became so popular that telling people you were going to IKEA became a euphemism in China for ‘going to a matchmaking event’. Genuine shoppers have been unable to see the furniture on sales because of the sleeping people on top of it . IKEA opened up their first shop in China in 1999 and the country is now home to three of the top five largest IKEA stores in the world, only beaten by one in Stockholm. After the first shop opened in Beijing, pictures emerged of shoppers camping out on the sofas with their families, reading newspapers and eating biscuits. The flat-pack chain was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943 and it is now the world’s largest furniture retailer. IKEA first opened in Beijing in 1998, and shoppers were pictured camping out on their sofas with newspapers .","Exhausted shoppers regularly fall asleep in IKEA stores across China .

12,"One of Suge Knight's alleged victims claims the rap mogul growled 'I'm going to kill you' then 'everything went black'. In his newly-released police interview obtained by TMZ, Cle 'Bone' Sloan tells officers Knight uttered the threat then yanked on the gear stick. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to Sloan by ramming over them in his pick-up truck. Knight, the co-founder of Death Row Records, has denied killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan in a parking lot in Compton on January 18. Scroll down for video . Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) told police Suge Knight (right) growled 'I'll kill you' before 'everything went black'. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to kill Sloan by running over them . Terry Carter (pictured) was killed, allegedly by Knight, in the Compton parking lot on January 18 . Sloan describes how the pair exchanged blows at the scene in January. 'He's mixing it up, he's f***ing with us and I caught him real good. Then he said, ""I'll kill you"". 'That's when everything when black.' Speaking to an LAPD officer, he claims Knight appeared to be reaching for a gun on the passenger seat while moving the gear stick. 'I don't if he was trying to put it in park or if he was trying to leave... I don't know. 'He started really reaching... when he said ""I'm gona kill you"", I thought ""oh sh** he's got a gun"". 'After that that's when everything kind of turned into a dream. I don't know what happened after that.' The audio release comes after pictures emerged of Suge Knight showing he had virtually no facial injuries when he was arrested. Knight was punched a number of times during the deadly confrontation, but close-ups taken by detectives show he only had a slight black eye. The images were released along with a number of key pieces of evidence as the court was shown footage of the deadly incident in Compton on January 18 for the first time. The footage, which was played by the prosecutor for the first time, shows Suge Knight's pickup truck (top left) pulling up to the driveway of a burger stand in Compton on January 29 . Just seconds later, there is a confrontation between Knight Cle 'Bone' Sloan and Terry Carter. Knight runs over Sloan's leg and then plows into Carter . Sloan is then seen lying on the ground in the aftermath. A bystander then runs over to help . Los Angeles Superior Court also released an image of the truck the rap mogul was driving when he ran over the two men . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen reviewed the items before determining Knight, 49, should stand trial on murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. The video shows Knight's pickup truck  pulling up to the driveway of the burger stand and Cle 'Bone' Sloan approaching the driver's side window. Sloan then approaches the driver's side window and punches the 49-year-old in response to a flurry of insults. Knight's pickup is seen backing up, throwing Sloan to the ground before the truck drives over his legs and then plows over Terry Carter - who died as a result. Among the other key pieces of evidence shown to the court were images of Knight taken immediately after his arrest. An hour-long interview with Sloan, who survived, describing what happened was also released. Coen ruled Thursday that there was enough evidence for Knight, 49, to stand trial on charges he killed Terry Carter and attempted to kill Sloan during a parking lot confrontation in late January. Knight has pleaded not guilty. His attorney has said Knight was fleeing an ambush by Sloan and others when he hit the men outside a Compton burger stand. The entire incident took approximately 30 seconds. The video, shot by a surveillance camera monitoring the drive-thru at the burger stand, continues until the arrival of a paramedic. The footage is likely to be used by both sides during Knight's trial. Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, has said the video appears to show an associate of Sloan's taking a gun off of him after he is run over, and jurors likely will be shown an enhanced version of the video. Knight turned himself in to authorities the morning after the incident. Detectives took pictures of him to try to show he did not have any serious injuries from the attack. Sloan's interview with detectives will also be crucial to the case since he is unlikely to repeat the lucid account of the event and his own actions that he gave investigators. In court on Monday, Sloan repeatedly said he didn't remember the incident and refused to identify Knight as the person who injured him, saying he didn't want . Another photo of the 49-year-old after he was detained was released by the court. Knight has pleaded not guilty to killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan. The close ups were intended to show the injuries he sustained from being punched in the face during the confrontation .

13,"Dogs are usually maestros when it comes to games of throw and catch - especially when there's food involved. But Fritz the Golden Retriever from California appears to lack any eye-mouth co-ordination skills, as a new video shows. The pooch was filmed wearing bunny ears this Easter trying - and miserably failing - to catch a hard-boiled egg between his teeth. Slow-motion footage shows him licking his lips and enthusiastically leaping up to catch the treat. However, despite his best efforts, the egg narrowly misses his jaw, bounces off his chest and hits the grass instead. A defeated Fritz is then seen hanging his head low, with his bunny ears falling to the ground. The pup has made quite a name for himself with his poor catching skills. Indeed, his YouTube channel boasts more than five million hits. Other videos show him being thrown steak, tacos, bread rolls, pizza and donuts, with misses every time. Fritz's owner, Evan Ball, hopes that one day the dog will be able to achieve the 'paw-fect' catch. He added: 'While we all intently anticipate the day when Fritz masters the skill of catching food in his mouth, we also patiently embrace the journey.'

15,"(CNN)The listeria outbreak that prompted Blue Bell Creameries to recall their entire product line dates to 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control. After weeks of gradual recalls, the company recalled all its ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet and other frozen treats sold in 23 states because they could be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, the company said Monday. The bacteria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, the elderly and others with weak immune systems. The CDC recommends consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand products. Three people in Kansas have died in the past year and 10 people in four states have fallen ill from the bacteria believed to have come from Blue Bell products, the CDC said Tuesday. One person became sick in Arizona, five in Kansas, one in Oklahoma and three in Texas, the CDC said. People first became sick in January 2010, the CDC said. The agency connected patients from 2010-2015 to the current outbreak through comparisons to a database of bacteria DNA. The origin of the strain is still unknown, but ""the fact that it was the same strain over the last five years suggests it could have lurked somewhere in the factory the whole time,"" said Dr. Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases. Tauxe said there may be more people sickened by listeria than the CDC knows about. The ""rough estimate"" is one more case exists for every case the CDC hears about, he said. ""There may be cases that never got diagnosed and we are looking at the patterns, the DNA patterns, to guide us to which cases might be related,"" he said. ""If tomorrow someone found another completely different pattern from (Blue Bell) ice cream products, we'd be looking to see if there were related cases to that as well."" Tauxe said the listeria strains found in Texas are different than those found in Oklahoma. ""It looks to us like there was one group of closely related strains related to ice cream from one factory and another different group related to a different factory,"" Tauxe said. ""We don't think something contaminated both factories."" Blue Bell decided to yank all its products after tests showed some half-gallon containers of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream contained listeria. ""This means Blue Bell has now had several positive tests for Listeria in different places and plants,"" the company said in a written statement. ""At this point, we cannot say with certainty how Listeria was introduced to our facilities, and so we have taken this unprecedented step,"" the company said. Listeria: What is it, how do you get it, and what's the risk? Listeria didn't get into ice cream through the milk because Blue Bell uses pasteurized milk, Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for Center for Science in the Public Interest, told CNN on Tuesday. But listeria could have been carried on foods like nuts that go into ice cream, she said. It can live for years on surfaces such as drains or pipes. ""Listeria can lay in a drain for years,"" she said. ""To get rid of it they'd have to take the equipment apart and clean it. It's a big job to control listeria in a plant."" Tauxe said, ""Within the factories it can get around and may have hung out and appeared in more than one place in the factory. ... The persistence of listeria inside the factory is what's important to address."" DeWaal said the listeria probably wasn't linked to Blue Bell in 2010 because one case wouldn't spark a full investigation. Other culprits, such as cheeses and deli meats, would be considered before ice cream products, because listeria can't grow in frozen temperatures, she said. ""Ice cream wouldn't have been one of the suspect foods in investigating those earlier cases,"" she said. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said three people in the state died from listeria there over the past year, possibly due to Blue Bell products. All five of the people who got sick in Kansas were patients being treated at the same hospital for unrelated causes, state health officials said. Four of them drank milkshakes at the hospital made with Blue Bell ice cream, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. It's not clear whether the fifth patient at the Kansas hospital had also consumed Blue Bell ice cream. In a separate outbreak in Texas, three patients were infected with listeria between 2011 and 2014. Tests of those listeria strains ""were nearly identical to Listeria strains isolated from ice cream produced at the Blue Bell Creameries' Oklahoma facility,"" the CDC said. In March, Blue Bell recalled 3-ounce cups of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream after a test found listeria in one of the cups in Kansas. Earlier this month, the recall expanded to some pints and half-gallon sizes of ice cream. This recall is not only affecting big chain grocery stores. One small ice cream shop in Texas has temporarily closed due to the recall. John Hayes, owner of Waffle Cone in Copperas Cove, Texas, said he exclusively uses Blue Bell. He received a phone call Monday night from Blue Bell letting him know a local driver will be picking up his 190-200 gallons of recalled ice cream this week. ""It is the third recall in the last month,"" said Hayes. ""I was upset, but more disappointed."" The shop owner has dealt with a shortage in flavors before, but nothing of his severity. ""It will be at least three, maybe four weeks for Blue Bell to replace the order,"" he said. Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems, the Food and Drug Administration says. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill with listeria each year; about 16% of these cases result in death. Although some people might suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths. Blue Bell CEO and President Paul Kruse promised to make sure all products are safe before they go back on sale. ""We're committed to doing the 100 percent right thing, and the best way to do that is to take all of our products off the market until we can be confident that they are all safe,"" Kruse said in a statement on the company's website. ""We are heartbroken about this situation and apologize to all of our loyal Blue Bell fans and customers."" Blue Bell said its new safety measures will include more extensive cleaning and sanitizing of equipment; increasing the swabbing and testing of facility surfaces by 800%; providing more employee training; and sending samples to a lab for testing every day.

16,"Atten-shun! The three leaders’ wives were on parade yesterday, marching across the country in support of their men, in support of the political party into which they married, in support of desperately important employment issues – keeping their idiot husbands in a job. In the corridors of power, Samantha Cameron, Justine Miliband and Miriam Clegg proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers, in more ways than one. Indeed, Samantha and Justine marched out in almost identical uniforms; dark slacks and blazers, paired with crisp shirts and sensible shoes. They looked like a pair of lady pilots from the budget Deficit airline, ready for their long haul flight to or from the land of Austerity, depending on whose husband wins. The only accessory missing were their welfare caps, which they must have left at home. Scroll down for video . In the corridors of power, Samantha Cameron, Justine Miliband  (left) and Miriam Clegg (right) proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers, in more ways than one . Sam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wife. That was until she visited a Sikh family for a cup of tea. Mrs Cameron respectfully took her shoes off before entering the home of local businessman Baljinder Hansraas and before anyone could scream: ‘Holy footcream!’ she unleashed them. Out popped a pair of startling tootsies, displaying what might just have been a hint of a bunion. All across the Home Counties, fragrant Tory women fell into a dead faint. For Sam Cam’s seldom seen feet seemed ever so slightly unkempt, unusual from a woman noted for her effortless elegance. They didn’t even seem very Tory toenails. Shriek – not even a drop of nail polish! I don’t know what the grooming squad will have to say about that, but I doubt it will be very flattering. Sam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wife . Perhaps we should not be too harsh. Not many women would come out smelling of roses and peppermint foot lotion if they unexpectedly had to reveal their workaday feet, still slightly steaming from punishing the pavements, to the nation. Yesterday’s shock unveiling of Crinkletoes Cameron was reminiscent of a moment during the last election, when Sarah Brown’s mangled trotters were revealed on a visit to a Hindu temple. The same furore greeted Brown’s podiatric horror story. And the message was the same. Woman goes out in public without painted toenails? The end of civilisation is nigh. Poor Sam Cam. If she had unveiled the perfect trimmed pedicure and three glistening coats of Rouge Noir, she would be accused of being self-indulgent. Wasting money on luxuries or wandering around with battered trotters. She can’t win. But in this election, who can? Justine resolutely wore the exact same outfit she wore last week, sending out a Take Me Serious message that Clothes Don’t Matter. Campaigning in Bradford, she looked like a grim pixie determined to prove to the Milifans that her man was the man. Or something like that. It was left to Miriam to show a bit of wackitude, pulling on a huge smile, a pair of Lib Dem yellow chinos and a nautical Breton top; she looked like Tweety Pie reporting for duty on the good ship Doomed. Miriam dragged her husband Nick along to a cookery lesson at a Wiltshire primary school. Aprons on, they exchanged loving looks as they and the pupils were shown how to make a variety of desserts using apples and blackberries. Soft fruit, fool, pudding and crumble? That is the history of the Lib Dems right there. Just a week to go and the wifely bandwagon rolls on. Their role is to be there, be visible, be bland and say nothing of import. In this carefully manicured – if not pedicured – election, the days of loudmouth Cherie wading in like a docker with gout have long gone. I almost miss them. Today’s wives must smile nicely. Today’s wives must not rock the boat. Today’s wives must wear ordinary high street clothes and nothing that hints at their secret, massive wealth – although Samantha’s two hundred quid spotty blouse must have slipped under Tory central office radar. Above all, however, today’s wives must remember that pulling your socks up is not as important as keeping them on.","All the party leader's wives have been spotted looking stylish in trousers .

19,"A woman has spoken of her regrets about going under the knife after a Turkish surgeon botched her facelift and left her with her ears sewn awkwardly to the side of her face. Belinda, 56, from Essex, had hoped the operation would deal with her jowls and says she was looking 'worn out' ahead of the procedure. But the 'horrendous' scars produced by the bungling surgeon have left her bereft of confidence and feeling worse than ever before. Scroll down for video . Belinda, 56, from Essex, admits she wishes she'd never had a facelift because of the 'horrendous' scars it left her around her ears - the result of a botched procedure she underwent in Turkey (pictured) Budget job: Belinda, who appears on tonight's episode of TLC's Extreme Beauty Disasters (pictured), travelled to Turkey to have the facelift because it was cheaper . Now Belinda is to appear on TLC's Extreme Beauty Disasters to warn of the dangers of travelling abroad for cut-price surgery - and to see if anything can be done about her botched facelift. Plastic surgeon consultant Vik Vijh commented: 'Her scars are really very poor. They're stretched and they are dragging down her earlobes.' Belinda's problems began when she noticed she was looking more tired than usual and set about finding a cosmetic solution. In the UK, the average facelift costs £7,900, so Belinda was thrilled when she found a Turkish surgeon offering cut-price operations that cost a fraction of the UK equivalent. Having already had successful cosmetic procedures in the past, among them breast implants and a tummy tuck, she says she felt positive about the prospect of facelift. Her husband agreed at the time, hoping it might 'freshen her up', but says, with hindsight, that 'it was one of the worst ideas I've ever had in my life.' Expert opinion: 'Her scars are really very poor,' admits plastic surgeon consultant Vik Vijh, who set out to correct the damage by re-doing her facelift. 'They're stretched and they are dragging down her earlobes' Mr Vijh (left) recommends another full face and neck lift to correct the damage, but warns Belinda (right) she could be risking nerve damage and further scarring . An excited Belinda then travelled to Turkey for the procedure, where such 'bargains' are common, checked into an Istanbul clinic and went under the knife. Initially thrilled with her 'fresh, plumped-out skin', doubts began to set in during the healing process. Expecting a dramatic change, the healed facelift, says Belinda, 'hadn't done anything' - except, much to her horror, leave her with earlobes that had been 'sewn' to the sides of her face. According to Mr Vijh, this was due to the surgeon stitching up Belinda's face in the wrong position, resulting in bad scarring that should have been concealed behind her ears, not around them . Still, Belinda is determined to go ahead, and after a gruelling session on the operating table at the hands of Mr Vijh (pictured), she comes out smiling . 'We've lifted her neck, we've pulled up her face, and got rid of all those scars,' Mr Vijh states. Pictured, Belinda's ear before (left) and after (right) the corrective surgery . As a result, another full face and neck lift was required, as well as extra surgery to hide the scarring. Belinda, who had been left miserable by her experience, says the new face lift has restored her confidence and left her happier. 'Finally I am happy,' she says. 'My scars have drastically reduced and now I can stop worrying about going out, or  about people looking at me from the side.' Extreme Beauty Disasters starts next Tuesday at 8pm on TLC .

20,"Jerusalem (CNN)The flame of remembrance burns in Jerusalem, and a song of memory haunts Valerie Braham as it never has before. This year, Israel's Memorial Day commemoration is for bereaved family members such as Braham. ""Now I truly understand everyone who has lost a loved one,"" Braham said. Her husband, Philippe Braham, was one of 17 people killed in January's terror attacks in Paris. He was in a kosher supermarket when a gunman stormed in, killing four people, all of them Jewish. The terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, recorded the attack on camera. Philippe Braham was laid to rest in Jerusalem's Givat Shaul cemetery after the attacks, not far from where the Jewish Agency held a memorial ceremony to mourn victims of terror. ""Today we all share the same pain,"" Valerie Braham said to the assembled crowd. ""I know they protect us from above."" As Israel mourns on the nation's remembrance day, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced after his weekly Cabinet meeting that French authorities had foiled a terror plot. Valls said that France is fully mobilized following January's attack, which allowed authorities to identify and stop the planned attack. The latest news is a painful reminder of Braham's recent loss. Braham now lives for her young children. She has two daughters and one son. Braham tells them stories of their father to keep his memory alive and to keep herself strong. She pauses as she speaks, finding the right words to describe the love of her life who was taken from her. ""We had 10 years of marriage together, and we were a perfect couple. We had no problems. We didn't fight. It was like the day we were married,"" she said, holding back tears. She has told this story before, but it doesn't seem to get any easier. One month after the terror attacks in Paris, a gunman attacked a synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, killing Dan Uzan, who was working as a security guard for a bat mitzvah party. Uzan, 37, was laid to rest in Copenhagen. Like Valerie Braham, Uzan's parents attended the memorial service in Jerusalem. The recent attacks were on the nation's collective mind as mourners gathered in groups to commemorate fallen soldiers and victims of terror. The Copenhagen attack forced Braham to relive her fear. ""I have no idea,"" she said, hesitating. ""It seems they found a way to attack outside of war. It seems easy for them to attack, and it's frightening."" When asked where she feels at home, Braham doesn't hesitate. It is her most confident answer. ""In Israel. Obviously, in Israel. In God's name, we will move to Israel."" Braham said she will move her family from Paris to Israel when she is ready, but she does not want to feel like she is running away.","""We all share the same pain,"" Valerie Braham tells Memorial Day crowd in Israel .

23,"Under pressure: Tony Cocker, the chief executive of E.ON, which has been forced to pay £7.75million to Citizens Advice after the regulator found the energy giant had overcharged customers after price rises . Power giant E.on has been ordered to pay a £7.75million penalty after it ripped off customers who were switching to rivals. The money will go to Citizens Advice to fund the organisation’s work helping those trying to cut their energy bills. E.on effectively overcharged thousands who decided to move to other suppliers after it announced price rises in January 2013 and again in early 2014. Industry rules state that energy companies must give customers 30 days’ notice of any price rise. Once a customer states they intend to move, the firm is not allowed to impose an exit fee or apply the new higher tariff even if the move takes place after the date of the increase. However, industry regulator Ofgem found that E.on broke the rules by hitting tens of thousands of departing customers with a higher tariff in the days before their account was switched. The firm admitted the mistake as far as customers who paid by direct debit or cheque were concerned. However, it failed to notify Ofgem that it also affected people with meters until late in the investigation. It has refunded £8 to £12 to 40,000 customers who paid by cash or cheque and is now trying to find another 7,000 meter customers to pay them an average of £3.42. While the sums involved are relatively low, Ofgem imposed a high penalty because E.on did the same thing in January 2012. At that time, it was ordered to refund £1.4million to customers and pay £300,000 in lieu of a penalty to Age UK. The firm claimed it had implemented new procedures to stop it happening again, but was guilty of the same mistake in both 2013 and 2014. 'Absolutely unacceptable': Regulator Ofgem said the penalty reflected E.ON's 'repeated failings' on billing rules after the company incorrectly imposed exit fees and overcharged customers . Ofgem’s enforcement chief, Sarah Harrison, said: ‘Our rules give customers a chance to avoid exit fees and higher costs when suppliers put up prices. These are important customer protections and it is vital suppliers play by the rules. The energy regulator has imposed fines on energy companies totalling £168 million since 2010. Britain's Big Six energy suppliers are responsible for £99million of the payments, with British Gas the worst offender among them with their figure totalling £34.6million. E.ON has been fined £24.8million in total. The payments are as follows: . November 2012: E.ON agrees to pay out £1.7million to customers and charities after customers were incorrectly charged exit fees or overcharged following price rises. July 2013: The company agrees a £3million package of fines and money for customers after it misreported the number of energy-saving light bulbs it had distributed under an energy efficiency scheme. May 2014: E.ON agrees to pay £12million to vulnerable customers for mis-selling. April 2015: The company agrees to pay £7.75million to Citizens Advice to help vulnerable customers in addition to £400,000 already paid to those affected, after it was found to have overcharged in the wake of price rises. ‘It is important that E.on has repaid potentially affected customers and co-operated with the investigation. However it’s absolutely unacceptable that it failed to provide these vital customer protections yet again and this persistent failure is the reason for the high penalty.’ Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said the ruling should send a warning to other firms. ‘Consumer rights cannot be ignored,’ she said. ‘Customers shouldn’t be trapped in higher bills. With prices up a third since 2010 people must have the freedom to shop around for a better deal. ‘Consumers must be confident that the regulator will take strong action when companies fail so this judgment is welcome news. ‘It is positive that the Ofgem penalty will go towards helping people who are struggling to heat and light their homes.’ E.on apologised and has agreed to fund an independent external audit into what went wrong. A spokesman said: ‘We have been open and transparent about this failure to Ofgem and have agreed to make a payment to Citizens Advice which will be used to support its Energy Best Deal Extra engagement programme, which provides face to face energy advice. ‘E.on is committed to ensuring that no one will lose out financially and is pleased that the payment is going to a worthwhile cause that will provide support to those in need.’","Firm to pay Citizens Advice £7.75m after incorrectly imposing exit fees .

24,"The devastated fiance of the late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough has written an emotional letter to her followers, revealing she was undergoing radiation treatment in her final weeks and 'giggling and drinking green smoothies' in her hospital bed until the day she died. Ms Ainscough, 30, died in late February following a lengthy fight with a rare and aggressive form of cancer known as epithelioid sarcoma. She spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight the cancer with a controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas and does not have scientific support. But after discussions with 'oncologists, healers and specialists around the world', in her final weeks - the most 'difficult' weeks of her fight - Ms Ainscough began a course of targeted radiation, her partner Tallon Pamenter has revealed. 'This was a risky and tough decision, but Jess bravely embraced this last chance option,' he said. Jessica Ainscough (left) was planning to marry her partner Tallon Pamenter this year. She died after a long fight with cancer in February . 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life,' Mr Pamenter said . Tribute: Jessica Ainscough died in late February after a seven-year-long battle with cancer . 'In true wellness warrior style, we integrated our natural healing regime with the recommended radiation. 'Finally the walls were broken down between conventional and unconventional medicine - I don't know why as a society we must choose one or the other. 'This was something Jess was looking forward with sharing (with her followers). It was an exciting evolution from her earlier days of feeling that she had to be part of one extreme world or the other.' Mr Pamenter said the six weeks of her radiation were among the toughest the couple - who were planning to marry this year - had been through. 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included.' The radiation successfully managed to shrink the tumour but 'some complications arose during the final stages of treatment'. 'Not long after, the words I LOVE YOU would leave my lips only to fall softly upon Jess's ears for the last time. 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since.' 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included,' She 'showed (her partner Tallon) what it means to live in a world full of love', he said in his tribute . 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since' 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life. 'I have been taken to a place so foreign and unknown with no navigational bearing on how to get back. 'Loved ones tell me to be strong during this time... but the thing is I don't want to be strong... I want to cry when I'm sad, yell when I'm angry and smile during those fleeting moments of happiness brought on by the memories we created together. 'I want to sit in silence and be present with every single emotion that decides to show up. 'It's in those moments I feel closest to her.' Ms Ainscough made the decision to undergo radiation after the fungating tumour in her left shoulder became large and painful. It began to interfere with her 'ability to enjoy her favourite things like walking our furbabies on the beach', Mr Parmenter said. Mr Pamenter told Daily Mail Australia she planned to tell her followers about her new treatment just days after she passed away. Ms Ainscough was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 when she was 22 and working at Dolly magazine, a favourite of teenage girls. She initially underwent targeted chemotherapy to her left arm, according to reports, but the cancer returned a year later. She also refused doctors' advice to have her left arm amputated. Jessica's mother was also diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by her daughter's fight, she also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. Mr Pamenter said his partner 'showed me what it means to live in a world full of love'.

25,"(CNN)Some fans of Lucille Ball want her statue removed from a park in her hometown, saying the ""ugly"" likeness does not do justice to the ""I Love Lucy"" star. The life-size bronze statue in Celoron, New York, has been likened to Conway Twitty, the snake from ""Beetlejuice"" and actor Steve Buscemi, among other unflattering comparisons. Even Mayor Scott Schrecengost has gone on record saying he does not care for the statue, which shows the comic star holding a bottle of fictional nutrition elixir Vitameatavegamin. And yet, it has been a tourist draw since 2009 for Celoron, the comedian's birthplace, attracting visitors who pose with the statue for pictures. A resident of Jamestown, where Ball grew up, started the Facebook page in 2012 ""We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue,"" seeking to get rid of the ""ugly"" statue. A story about the group on Yahoo! News this week spread through the internet, reviving debate over what to do with the statue. The founder of the Facebook group would like to see the statue replaced with a new one outside a planned Comedy Hall of Fame in Jamestown, home to the Lucy-Desi Museum & Center for Comedy and the annual Lucille Ball Comedy Festival.

26,"(CNN)A high temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a pleasant day in early spring -- unless you're in Antarctica. The chilly continent recorded the temperature (15.5 degrees Celsius) on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica, according to the Weather Underground. The temperature was recorded at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctica Peninsula, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. (Note to map lovers: The Argentine base is not geographically part of the South American continent.) The World Meteorological Organization, a specialized United Nations agency, is in the process of setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence, said Randy Cerveny, the agency's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and Arizona State University professor of geographical sciences. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations, Cerveny said. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to Cerveny, who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall. Researchers who study climate change carefully watch weather changes in the Antarctic region and elsewhere for evidence that the Earth is getting warmer.","High temperatures are recorded on the northern tip of the Antarctica Peninsula .

29,"Officials at an elementary school in Maine have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues without first seeking the approval of parents. During a lesson on tolerance and acceptance, children at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point were read I Am Jazz, a book about a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender. Some parents are unhappy with the school after they say their children came home with questions about gender and wondering if they too might be trans. I Am Jazz is a book about a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender . One unnamed mom was so angry she contacted conservative pundit Sean Hannity after she felt that the school ignored her initial complaint. 'I feel like my thoughts, feelings and beliefs were completely ignored….My right as a parent to allow or not allow this discussion with my child was taken from me. It is very upsetting to me that I didn't have an option at all,' she told Hannity.com. 'When I spoke with the principal he was very cold about it. It's amazing how thoughtless the school has been with this whole thing.' The mother claims that lesson prompted her 7-year-old son to start asking a lot of questions and questioning if he might be trans - something that he had never previously spoken about. 'I was taken aback by it… Being seven, once you put something in their mind they don't forget so easily,' she said. In the wake of Hannity contacting the school asking for clarity, officals have now apologized. Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, said she supported the reading of the book but admitted that parents should have been first notified. Officials at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point, Maine, have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues . Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, admitted that parents should have been first notified . 'We have a practice of if a topic is considered sensitive, parents should be informed. In this situation, that didn't happen,' she said. 'The whole culture at Mitchell School is about teaching tolerance and respect. The people presenting the lesson thought [I Am Jazz] was one more piece of teaching that lesson. In retrospect, we understand that toleration is tolerating people of all opinions.' But at least one parents has come out in support of the school's initial decision to select the book as appropiate for teaching young students. 'People in this country, parents in this country are outraged by bullying, teen suicide rates and the depression in children. The staff of Mitchell School is doing something about this. By teaching acceptance and love they are shedding a light on [LGBTI] issues,' reports Gay Star News. 'LGBTQ issues should never be classified as a ""sensitive subject"" — there is nothing sensitive about the way we are born. Blonde hair, brown hair, gay, straight or somewhere in-between, we are all people and we all need acceptance.' The book at the center of the controversy, I Am Jazz, is based off of the life of now 14-year-old Jazz Jennings who, although born a boy, claims to have identified as a girl since he was two-years-old. 'From the time she was two years old, Jazz knew that she had a girl's brain in a boy's body. She loved pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn't feel like herself in boys' clothing,' reads the book's description on Amazon.com. 'This confused her family, until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way. Jazz's story is based on her real-life experience and she tells it in a simple, clear way that will be appreciated by picture book readers, their parents, and teachers.'","Officials at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point, Maine, have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues .
